## Technical info

The repository builds as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source is set to the `docs` directory so that meta files don't mix with the actual Visualbook files. The directory must be called `docs` as that's the only name GitHub supports as of now. For the domain name to work, the CNAME file must exist and the CNAME record for logo.junior.guru must be set to honzajavorek.github.io.
